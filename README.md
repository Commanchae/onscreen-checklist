# Onscreen Checklist Documentation üìù
This project mainly uses PyQt5 with custom functions to faciliate a checklist. The GUI is set on the topmost layer of all applications, meaning it will constantly be seen despite changing applications.

## üéÑ Installation
- As of v1.0.0, installation is unavailable.

## üîª Usage
Running the Onscreen Checklist Program will present the following UI on the left-hand side of the screen...

- As can be seen, it is a GUI on the left of the screen with **an "ADD" button**, **a "REMOVE" button** (initially disabled), **a minimize toggle button**, **an exit button**, and a "sort by" **drop-down list**.
- NOTE: The "sort by" drop-down list does not currently have any functionalities in version 1.0.0
  
  ### Adding an Item ‚ûï
 - In clicking the "ADD" button, a second UI will appear right below the main one where a user can add in a To-Do Item by inputting a title, a description/extra information, and the importance rating.

- The user may then press "DONE" to add the item to the to do-list.

### Clicking an Item üñ±Ô∏è
- Once an item exists in the to-do list, clicking on any item will now display the item's description along with the importance level set by the user. The "REMOVE" button will also now be available for use.

### Minimizing the GUI ‚ûñ
- To minimize the GUI, the minimize button on the main GUI should be clicked. 
- Once the button has been clicked, the GUI will minimize and will appear as a blue bar on the left-hand side of the screen such as follows...

- Clicking on the bar will open the GUI once more with previous information intact.

### Roadmap üöÄ
- [ ] Create dark mode / allow for a variety of color palettes.
- [ ] Improve to-do item display in the main GUI.
- [ ] Allow users to input the date/time to accomplish the to-do item by as an optional feature.
- [ ] Allow users to sort by a to-do list's importance / date.
- [ ] Implement an easy way to install / use the program.
